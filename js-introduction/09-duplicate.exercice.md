# Duplicate

Declare a variable `duplicate` that repeat the provided variable `sentence`,
separated by a `,` and add an `!` at the end.

> so if sentence would be `Hello there`, we expect `Hello there, Hello there !`.

## Tests

### `duplicate` value should repeat `'I told you so'`

```js
let sentence = 'I told you so'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'I told you so, I told you so !')
```

### `duplicate` value should repeat `'Not again'`

```js
let sentence = 'Not again'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'Not again, Not again !')
```

### `duplicate` value should repeat `'I knew it'`

```js
let sentence = 'I knew it'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'I knew it, I knew it !')
```
