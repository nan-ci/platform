# Placeholders

We will provide a variable `name` and `age`. They will be pre-declared by us.

Declare a `presentation` variable of the string:

> `Hello, my name is` **name** `and I'm` **age** `years old`

But use placeholders to build the string you will put inside `presentation`.  
Put the values of the provided variables `age` and `name` inside those
placeholders.

## Tests

### `presentation` value includes `age` and `name`.

```js
let name = 'Patrick'
let age = 48
// Your code
equal(presentation, `Hello, my name is Patrick and I'm 48 years old`)
```

### `presentation` value still includes `age` and `name`.

```js
let name = 'Jeremy'
let age = 27
// Your code
equal(presentation, `Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm 27 years old`)
```
