# Loops

First of all, Create a file with name `loop.js`.

- Create a program to show 5 stars in the console through a loop. In each row we have a star, and the number of stars in that row, depends on the row we are in. So in the first row we have one star, in the second row we have 2 stars, and so on.

## Using console.log

To display output from a script into a console, use the function console.log:

```js
console.log() // <- this will show an empty line
```

### Tests

```js
assert.strictEqual(row, 5)
assert.strictEqual(typeof stars, 'string')
```
