# A String of Number

Declare two variables:

- use the identifier `seven` with the value being a string of the number `7`
- use the identifier `seventySeven` with the value being a string of the number
  `77`

> “Number 7 is a legendary number, many great players who have worn it. I hope I
> could do credit in the field with this number.” \
> ― Kylian Mbappé

## Tests

### As a number, `seven` value is `7`

```js
equal(Number(seven), 7)
```

### As a number, `seventySeven` value is `77`

```js
equal(Number(seventySeven), 77)
```

### Somehow, the type of `seven` and `seventySeven` value must be strings

```js
equal(typeof seven, 'string')
equal(typeof seventySeven, 'string')
```
