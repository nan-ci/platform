# Values

In this document I will try to explain the core values that I try to consider while thinking about features of the platform.

## A School to learn, not to grade

Schools need to prioritise learning over evaluation, nearly all the schools today focus on grading students without much consideration to the implications of using a simplistic number to represent a student value.

This need for **grade** is actually a big limitation in what schools can learn and what students will want to learn.

Once you start telling people that they need a good grade to pass, then getting a good grade is all that matter, not really learning, having fun, meeting people and all other really valuable things that you can do at a school.

It encourage **cheating** as they get rewarded the same as others by being able to fool the system, and value sociopathic behaviours, much like money does.


##  Employement is not a goal

Schools usually target the workforce and employement as a goal, and by doing so are teaching students a lot of useless things because *it is done this way* in enterprise.

For example, some new technology might be of interest to the student, but no established company will risk using young, bleeding edge technology, as such, schools are limited to teach only "safe" technologies, by such, are obsolete by design, and the students can feel that what they are learning is already dated. This is specially true in a fast moving field like IT.

But more importantly schools also prepare you for the enterprise mindset, be a good pawn to your boss, don't question authorities, to give your all to your work and silence your common sense, etc... All of those ideas roting the youth, we can easly see around us how exploiting, politicised and corrupted enterprise can be, profiting from ecological destruction, malnutrition and much more.

While this might sound grim, I believe it is up to us to stop teaching people to respect those in power that abuse it, to achieve a better world, we must first let go of the old one.


## Student is kings

The School staff need must never trump the student needs.

Every decision made must try it's best to consider it's impact on the students quality of life and learning.
