## Student Needs

### Playfulness

The school must be a place the student want's to be, learning should be fun and looked forward to, not dreaded.
Lecture and subjects should be relatable and fun, diverse enough so anyone can find it's cup of tea.


### Social

Social interaction with other students should be encouraged and valued, school is the ideal place to meet people for your projects. Having a good network of people that know how you work and how to interact with you is the real key to employement.

It empowers entreprenarial people so they can build teams that build products for their values.

The school should provide a way to keep students interacting with it's network and always stay open for meeting newer students and older alumni.


### Motivating

Motivation is precious and should be stimulated by the school, while I have no clue how to generate motivation, we can at least be careful at avoiding at all cost what is detrimental to it.


### Structured

Structuration allow to give students a good idea where he stands, what is left, how much he as done, how fast he is going.

It is key for motivation, avoiding feeling lost and renforcing achievements.


### Freedom

Also allowing some amount of freedom to avoid limiting the students to the schools ideas and pushing them to dig deeper is essencial, again, like motivation, it is more about making sure we are not preventing the students to explore an anyway and more guiding them.
